# aerisweather
<strong>Clone the project</strong>
<pre>git clone https://github.com/clifstone/aerisweather.git</pre>

<strong>Install dependencies:</strong><br>
Open a terminal within the cloned folder or cd into it then, -> RUN THE COMMAND:
<pre>npm i</pre>

Once that is done, while your terminal is still open, -> RUN THE COMMAND:
<pre>cd aerisweather</pre>

After you've cd'd into the folder, -> RUN THE COMMAND:
<pre>npm run build</pre>

After you run the build, navigate to the /dist folder. From there, you should be able to open the index.html file in any browser. A good double-click on it should do the trick ;)
